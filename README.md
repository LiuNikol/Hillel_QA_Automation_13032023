# Hillel_QA_Automation_13032023

Hello!

I am Liudmyla. I live in the Kyiv region. I have been working full-time as a Manual QA for almost two years. At this stage, I decided to take an automation course to develop my skills in order to gradually automate the testing processes on the project where I work.
